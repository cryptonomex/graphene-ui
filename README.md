Graphene-UI
============

This is a light wallet that connects to a Graphene based API server such as the Bitshares *witness_node* executable.

It *stores all keys locally* in the browser, *never exposing your keys to anyone* as it signs transactions locally before transmitting them to the API server which then broadcasts them to the blockchain network. The wallet is encrypted with a password of your choosing and encrypted in a browser database.

### Getting started

Graphene-UI depends node Node.js, and version 6+ is required. It has not yet been tested with v7.

On Ubuntu and OSX, the easiest way to install Node is to use the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

To install NVM for Linux/OSX, simply copy paste the following in a terminal:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash
nvm install v6
nvm use v6
```

Once you have Node installed, you can clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene-ui.git
cd graphene-ui
```

Before launching the GUI you will need to install the npm packages for each subdirectory:
```
cd web
npm install
```

## Running the dev server

The dev server uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) in combination with Webpack 2.

Once all the packages have been installed you can start the development server by going to the `web` folder and running:
```
npm start
```

Once the compilation is done the GUI will be available in your browser at: `localhost:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080`. Hot Reloading is enabled so the browser will live update as you edit the source files.

### Testnet
By default graphene-ui connects to the live Bitshares network, but it's very easy to switch it to the testnet run by Xeroc. To do so, open the UI in a browser, go to Settings, then under Access, select the *Public Testnet Server* in the dropdown menu. You should also change the faucet if you need to create an account, the testnet faucet address is https://testnet.bitshares.eu. 

The UI will reload and connect to the testnet, where you can use the faucet to create an account and receive an initial sum of test BTS.

## Production
If you'd like to host your own wallet somewhere, you should create a production build and host it using NGINX or Apache. In order to create a prod bundle, simply run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a bundle in the /dist folder that can be hosted with the web server of your choice.

### Installable wallets
We use [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) to provide installable wallets, available for Windows, OSX and Linux Debian platforms such as Ubuntu. First, install the required packages in the `electron` folder. Then go to the `web` folder and run `npm run electron`. This will compile the UI with some special modifications for use with Electron, and copy the result to the root `electron/build` folder. Now go back to the `electron` folder and run `npm run release` in order to build a wallet for your platform. 

## Contributing
Graphene-UI is open source and anyone is free to contribute. PR's are welcomed and will be reviewed in a timely manner, and long-term contributors will be given access to the repo.
